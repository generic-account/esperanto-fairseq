Automatically segments Esperanto words into their component morphemes

### Dependencies

Only Linux is guaranteed to be supported

scala (2.11 definitely works)

python3

### src/WordSegmenter.scala

Algorithm to segment words. Uses two basic steps:

1. Find all possible segmentations via trie traversal, apply rules unless otherwise specified
2. Find best segmentation using a Markov model or maximal match algorithm. 

##### Usage
```
    scala WordSegmenter.WordSegmenter trainingFile morphemesByTypeDirectory [-m|r|n|b|t]
```

See experiments/run\_tests.sh for example usage

##### Options
```
    Default: apply rules, use unigram Markov model
    -m: Use maximal morpheme matching instead of Markov model
    -r: Skip disambiguation (step 2)
    -n: Apply no rules in step 1
    -b: Use bigram Markov model
    -t: Use trigram Markov model
```

Concatenate options if using more than one. e.g. use "-mn", not "-m -n"

Note: unigram, bigram, trigram Markov models refer to 2-gram sequence, 3-gram sequence, 4-gram sequence respectively, as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram#Examples

##### Build
run:
```
    src/build.sh
```

### morphemesByType/

Defines and classifies all valid morphemes.

Non content morphemes are predefined, following the Akademia Vortaro (http://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/akademia_vortaro/), with manual classification

morphemesByType/normal/generated is built using morphemesByType/normal/build/classify.py

Uses the dictionary "vortaro.xml" from Esperantilo: http://www.xdobry.de/esperantoedit/index_en.html

To regenerate normal roots run:
```
    morphemesByType/normal/build/get_not_normal.sh
    morphemesByType/normal/build/classify.py
```

To remake morphemesByType/sets directory (what WordSegmenter.scala uses), run:
```
    morphemesByType/make_sets.sh
```

### espsof/

Test set from ESPSOF. All presegmented words from the original source are in espsof.txt. testset\_espsof.txt contains all words with known morphemes (also occur in Esperantilo).

To remake test set (e.g. if the set of known morphemes changes), run:
```
    espsof/make_testset.sh
```

### experiments/

Create a tagged training set and test set from the ESPSOF test set, and run WordSegmenter.scala. Analyze the segmentation accuracy.

To create tagged training/test sets, run:
```
    experiments/run_tests.sh -f
```

To run WordSegmenter.scala with predefined options, run:
```
    experiments/run_tests.sh -r
```

To create tagged sets and run WordSegmenter.scala, run:
```
    experiments/run_tests.sh
```

To analyze the segmentation accuracy, run:
```
    experiments/analyze.py expectFile resultsFile [-r]
```
Use -r if and only if -r was used when running WordSegmenter.scala
